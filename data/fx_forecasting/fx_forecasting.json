    "description": "Task: Multivariate Forecasting of Major FX Log-Return Dynamics\n\n**1. Task Overview**\n\nThis task evaluates a model\u2019s ability to forecast 5-day multivariate log-return sequences for seven major foreign-exchange pairs, using the preceding 40 days of market behaviour as input.  \nThe objective is to capture medium-horizon FX dynamics shaped by monetary-policy shifts, macroeconomic announcements, and cross-currency interactions.\n\nTask Type: Forecasting  \nInput Shape: [40, 7] log-return sequences  \nTarget Shape: [5, 7] log-return sequences  \n\n**2. Task Description**\n\nParticipants must develop a supervised forecasting model that takes as input 40 days of log-returns across the following currency pairs:\nEUR_USD, GBP_USD, USD_JPY, USD_CNY, AUD_USD, USD_CHF, USD_CAD.\n\nThe model must then produce a forecast for the next 5 days of log-returns for the same seven FX pairs.  \nEach data sample therefore contains:\n- an input matrix of shape [40, 7],  \n- a target matrix of shape [5, 7].  \n\nThe forecasting challenge requires learning medium-horizon temporal relationships such as:\n- interest-rate\u2013driven adjustments across currency pairs,  \n- policy divergence patterns between central banks,  \n- cross-currency risk transmission,  \n- regime shifts in global risk sentiment.\n\nAny forecasting model is permitted, including transformer models, recurrent architectures, sequence-to-sequence networks, temporal convolutional models, or regression-based baselines, provided that produced outputs match the required [5, 7] structure.\n\n**3. Dataset**\n\nThe dataset is constructed from daily foreign-exchange rates converted into log-returns to normalize scale and focus on incremental exchange-rate movements.  \nEach supervised sample pairs a 40-day input window with a 5-day prediction horizon, capturing nearly two months of FX dynamics prior to forecasting the next week.\n\nThe dataset includes:\n- Train set  \n- Validation set  \n- Test set  \n\nParticipants should develop and tune models using the train and validation splits.  \nThe test set will not be provided; final ranking is based solely on performance on the held-out test set using the primary metric (RMSE).\n\n**4. Evaluation**\n\nForecast accuracy is assessed using three metrics well suited to multivariate FX prediction:\n\n- RMSE  \n  Root mean squared error evaluating magnitude accuracy of predicted log-returns.\n\n- MAE  \n  Mean absolute error providing a stable measure of forecast accuracy less sensitive to outliers.\n\n- MAPE  \n  Mean absolute percentage error offering a scale-normalised accuracy measure across currencies with differing volatility structures.\n\nRMSE is the primary ranking metric.  \nMAE and MAPE supply additional insight into robustness and scale-adjusted forecast alignment.  \nEvaluation metric code for RMSE, MAE, and MAPE will be provided to participants.\n\n**5. Success Criteria**\n\nA strong submission should:\n- Achieve low RMSE\uff0cMAE, and MAPE over the 5-day prediction horizon.  \n- Produce stable, well-calibrated forecasts without drift or excessive noise.  \n- Capture medium-horizon cross-currency interactions, volatility patterns, and regime behaviour reflected in the input sequences.\n\n**6. Difficulty Level**\n\nDifficulty: Intermediate\n\nModels must learn a rich combination of macroeconomic drivers, cross-currency dependencies, and medium-horizon temporal structure to generate accurate forecasts across major FX pairs.",
