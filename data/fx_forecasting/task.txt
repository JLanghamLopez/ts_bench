Task: Multivariate Forecasting of Major FX Log-Return Dynamics

**1. Task Overview**

This task evaluates a model’s ability to forecast 5-day multivariate log-return sequences for seven major foreign-exchange pairs, using the preceding 40 days of market behaviour as input.
The objective is to capture medium-horizon FX dynamics shaped by monetary-policy shifts, macroeconomic announcements, and cross-currency interactions.

Task Type: Forecasting
Input Shape: [40, 7] log-return sequences
Target Shape: [5, 7] log-return sequences

**2. Task Description**

Participants must develop a supervised forecasting model that takes as input 40 days of log-returns across the following currency pairs:
EUR_USD, GBP_USD, USD_JPY, USD_CNY, AUD_USD, USD_CHF, USD_CAD.

The model must then produce a forecast for the next 5 days of log-returns for the same seven FX pairs.
Each data sample therefore contains:
- an input matrix of shape [40, 7],
- a target matrix of shape [5, 7].

The forecasting challenge requires learning medium-horizon temporal relationships such as:
- interest-rate–driven adjustments across currency pairs,
- policy divergence patterns between central banks,
- cross-currency risk transmission,
- regime shifts in global risk sentiment.

Any forecasting model is permitted, including transformer models, recurrent architectures, sequence-to-sequence networks, temporal convolutional models, or regression-based baselines, provided that produced outputs match the required [5, 7] structure.

**3. Dataset**

The dataset is constructed from daily foreign-exchange rates converted into log-returns to normalize scale and focus on incremental exchange-rate movements.
Each supervised sample pairs a 40-day input window with a 5-day prediction horizon, capturing nearly two months of FX dynamics prior to forecasting the next week.

The dataset includes:
- Train set
- Validation set
- Test set

Participants should develop and tune models using the train and validation splits.
The test set will not be provided; final ranking is based solely on performance on the held-out test set using the primary metric (RMSE).

**4. Evaluation**

Forecast accuracy is assessed using three metrics well suited to multivariate FX prediction:

- RMSE
  Root mean squared error evaluating magnitude accuracy of predicted log-returns.

- MAE
  Mean absolute error providing a stable measure of forecast accuracy less sensitive to outliers.

- MAPE
  Mean absolute percentage error offering a scale-normalised accuracy measure across currencies with differing volatility structures.

RMSE is the primary ranking metric.
MAE and MAPE supply additional insight into robustness and scale-adjusted forecast alignment.
Evaluation metric code for RMSE, MAE, and MAPE will be provided to participants.

**5. Success Criteria**

A strong submission should:
- Achieve low RMSE，MAE, and MAPE over the 5-day prediction horizon.
- Produce stable, well-calibrated forecasts without drift or excessive noise.
- Capture medium-horizon cross-currency interactions, volatility patterns, and regime behaviour reflected in the input sequences.

**6. Difficulty Level**

Difficulty: Intermediate

Models must learn a rich combination of macroeconomic drivers, cross-currency dependencies, and medium-horizon temporal structure to generate accurate forecasts across major FX pairs.
