Task: Medium-Horizon Multivariate Forecasting of Commodity Log-Returns

**1. Task Overview**

This task evaluates a model’s ability to forecast 5-day multivariate log-return sequences for nine major commodities, using the preceding 60 days of observations as input.
The objective is to capture medium-term commodity-market dynamics influenced by seasonal behaviour, macroeconomic conditions, weather shocks, and cross-commodity linkages.

Task Type: Forecasting
Input Shape: [60, 9] log-return sequences
Target Shape: [5, 9] log-return sequences

**2. Task Description**

Participants must build a supervised forecasting model that takes as input 60 consecutive days of log-returns across the following commodities:
gold, silver, copper, crude_oil_wti, crude_oil_brent, natural_gas, corn, wheat, soybeans.

The model must then predict the next 5 days of log-returns for the same nine assets.
Each supervised pair therefore consists of:
- an input matrix of shape [60, 9],
- a target matrix of shape [5, 9].

The forecasting problem requires capturing medium-horizon features such as:
- persistent seasonal factors in energy and agricultural markets,
- macroeconomic news effects that propagate slowly across commodities,
- volatility clustering within metals and energy,
- cross-commodity spillovers (e.g., oil-price effects on agricultural inputs).

Any forecasting architecture may be used, such as transformer models, sequence-to-sequence architectures, temporal convolutional networks, RNN-based models, or regression-style baselines, provided that outputs match the expected [5, 9] structure.

**3. Dataset**

The dataset contains daily settlement prices converted into log-returns to normalize scale and provide a stationary representation across commodities with large differences in price levels.
Each supervised sample consists of a 60-day input window and a 5-day forecast horizon, offering roughly three months of information for predicting the subsequent week.

The dataset is split into:
- Train set
- Validation set
- Test set

Participants should develop and tune models using the train and validation splits.
The test set will not be provided; final ranking is based solely on performance on the held-out test set using the primary metric (RMSE).

**4. Evaluation**

Forecast performance is measured using three metrics suited to multivariate commodity prediction:

- RMSE
  Root mean squared error capturing magnitude-based forecast accuracy.

- MAE
  Mean absolute error providing a robust error measure less affected by large spikes common in commodity markets.

- MAPE
  Mean absolute percentage error offering a scale-independent measure useful for commodities with heterogeneous volatility levels.

RMSE is the primary ranking metric.
Evaluation metric code for RMSE, MAE, and MAPE will be provided to participants.

**5. Success Criteria**

A strong submission should:
- Achieve low RMSE, MAE, and MAPE scores on the 5-day prediction horizon.
- Capture medium-term inter-commodity relationships, volatility regimes, and structural dependencies.
- Produce forecasts without excessive noise, drift, or systematic bias.
- Demonstrate stability across commodities with varied behaviours (e.g., energy vs. metals vs. agricultural assets).

Final ranking is determined by RMSE performance on the test set.

**6. Difficulty Level**

Difficulty: Advanced

The long input window and complex medium-horizon dependencies require models to capture both temporal and cross-commodity structure under diverse market conditions.
