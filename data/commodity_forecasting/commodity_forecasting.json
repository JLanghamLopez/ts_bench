    "description": "Task: Medium-Horizon Multivariate Forecasting of Commodity Log-Returns\n\n**1. Task Overview**\n\nThis task evaluates a model\u2019s ability to forecast 5-day multivariate log-return sequences for nine major commodities, using the preceding 60 days of observations as input.  \nThe objective is to capture medium-term commodity-market dynamics influenced by seasonal behaviour, macroeconomic conditions, weather shocks, and cross-commodity linkages.\n\nTask Type: Forecasting  \nInput Shape: [60, 9] log-return sequences  \nTarget Shape: [5, 9] log-return sequences  \n\n**2. Task Description**\n\nParticipants must build a supervised forecasting model that takes as input 60 consecutive days of log-returns across the following commodities:\ngold, silver, copper, crude_oil_wti, crude_oil_brent, natural_gas, corn, wheat, soybeans.\n\nThe model must then predict the next 5 days of log-returns for the same nine assets.  \nEach supervised pair therefore consists of:\n- an input matrix of shape [60, 9],  \n- a target matrix of shape [5, 9].  \n\nThe forecasting problem requires capturing medium-horizon features such as:\n- persistent seasonal factors in energy and agricultural markets,  \n- macroeconomic news effects that propagate slowly across commodities,  \n- volatility clustering within metals and energy,  \n- cross-commodity spillovers (e.g., oil-price effects on agricultural inputs).\n\nAny forecasting architecture may be used, such as transformer models, sequence-to-sequence architectures, temporal convolutional networks, RNN-based models, or regression-style baselines, provided that outputs match the expected [5, 9] structure.\n\n**3. Dataset**\n\nThe dataset contains daily settlement prices converted into log-returns to normalize scale and provide a stationary representation across commodities with large differences in price levels.  \nEach supervised sample consists of a 60-day input window and a 5-day forecast horizon, offering roughly three months of information for predicting the subsequent week.\n\nThe dataset is split into:\n- Train set  \n- Validation set  \n- Test set  \n\nParticipants should develop and tune models using the train and validation splits.  \nThe test set will not be provided; final ranking is based solely on performance on the held-out test set using the primary metric (RMSE).\n\n**4. Evaluation**\n\nForecast performance is measured using three metrics suited to multivariate commodity prediction:\n\n- RMSE  \n  Root mean squared error capturing magnitude-based forecast accuracy.\n\n- MAE  \n  Mean absolute error providing a robust error measure less affected by large spikes common in commodity markets.\n\n- MAPE  \n  Mean absolute percentage error offering a scale-independent measure useful for commodities with heterogeneous volatility levels.\n\nRMSE is the primary ranking metric.  \nEvaluation metric code for RMSE, MAE, and MAPE will be provided to participants.\n\n**5. Success Criteria**\n\nA strong submission should:\n- Achieve low RMSE, MAE, and MAPE scores on the 5-day prediction horizon.  \n- Capture medium-term inter-commodity relationships, volatility regimes, and structural dependencies.  \n- Produce forecasts without excessive noise, drift, or systematic bias.  \n- Demonstrate stability across commodities with varied behaviours (e.g., energy vs. metals vs. agricultural assets).  \n\nFinal ranking is determined by RMSE performance on the test set.\n\n**6. Difficulty Level**\n\nDifficulty: Advanced\n\nThe long input window and complex medium-horizon dependencies require models to capture both temporal and cross-commodity structure under diverse market conditions.",
