    "description": "Task: Multivariate Generative Modelling of Equity Log-Return Sequences\n\n**1. Task Overview**\n\nThis task evaluates a model\u2019s ability to generate realistic 5-day multivariate log-return sequences for a set of major U.S. equities.\nThe objective is to reproduce short-horizon market behaviour, including sector-specific risk, cross-stock co-movements, and rapid responses to market news and sentiment.\n\nTask Type: Generative modelling  \nTrajectory Shape: [5, 8] log-return sequences  \n\n**2. Task Description**\n\nParticipants must build a generative model capable of producing realistic 5-day paths of daily log-returns across the following U.S. equities:\naapl, amzn, goog, jnj, jpm, meta, msft, nvda.\n\nEach data sample is a 5-day window of log-returns over these eight equities.  \nThe model must generate synthetic 5-day trajectories that exhibit similar distributional, temporal, and cross-sectional characteristics to the real sequences.\n\nSince the task focuses on short-horizon dynamics, models should capture the behaviour associated with week-long market cycles, including reactions to earnings reports, macroeconomic announcements, sector rotation, liquidity shocks, and changes in market sentiment.\n\nAny generative architecture may be used (for example, diffusion models, GANs, VAE-based models, normalizing flows, or signature-based models), as long as the generated output follows the required trajectory dimensions.\n\n**3. Dataset**\n\nThe dataset consists of daily closing prices for eight large publicly traded U.S. companies drawn from multiple sectors, representing a diverse cross-section of the equity market.  \nRaw prices are converted to log-returns to:\n- normalize scale differences across equities,  \n- improve stationarity, and  \n- reflect percentage changes in asset value.\n\nThe time series are segmented using windows of length 5 with a stride of 2.  \nThis design creates sequences that capture short-term market movements while keeping moderate overlap between windows to preserve statistical richness without excessive redundancy.\n\nThe dataset already includes:\n- Train set  \n- Validation set  \n- Test set  \n\nParticipants should develop and tune models using the train and validation splits.  \nThe test set will not be provided; final ranking is based solely on performance on the held-out test set using the primary metric (HistogramMetric).\n\n**4. Evaluation**\n\nTo evaluate the fidelity of generated equity log-return sequences, three metrics are used:\n\n- HistogramMetric  \n  Measures distributional similarity between real and generated sequences by comparing empirical histograms of returns.\n\n- CrossCorrelationMetric  \n  Compares lagged cross-stock correlation patterns, assessing whether sector-driven and market-wide co-movements are preserved.\n\n- AutoCorrelationMetric  \n  Evaluates autocorrelation profiles within each equity, capturing short-horizon temporal dependencies and mild mean-reversion behaviour.\n\nHistogramMetric serves as the primary ranking metric.  \nCrossCorrelationMetric and AutoCorrelationMetric provide insight into cross-sectional and temporal alignment.  \nEvaluation metric code for all three metrics will be provided to participants.\n\n**5. Success Criteria**\n\nA strong submission should:\n- Achieve low discrepancy on HistogramMetric on the test set. \n- Preserve cross-equity dependence patterns reflected by CrossCorrelationMetric \n- Match short-horizon temporal characteristics measured by AutoCorrelationMetric.\n- Generate stable, non-degenerate samples that avoid mode collapse, excessive smoothing, or unrealistic volatility patterns.\n\n**6. Difficulty Level**\n\nDifficulty: Easy\n\nThis task involves modelling short 5-day multivariate sequences with comparatively simple temporal dependencies and cross-sectional structure. The reduced horizon and lower volatility environment make it the most accessible of the three tasks.",
