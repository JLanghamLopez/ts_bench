Task: Multivariate Generative Modelling of Equity Log-Return Sequences

**1. Task Overview**

This task evaluates a model’s ability to generate realistic 5-day multivariate log-return sequences for a set of major U.S. equities.
The objective is to reproduce short-horizon market behaviour, including sector-specific risk, cross-stock co-movements, and rapid responses to market news and sentiment.

Task Type: Generative modelling
Trajectory Shape: [5, 8] log-return sequences

**2. Task Description**

Participants must build a generative model capable of producing realistic 5-day paths of daily log-returns across the following U.S. equities:
aapl, amzn, goog, jnj, jpm, meta, msft, nvda.

Each data sample is a 5-day window of log-returns over these eight equities.
The model must generate synthetic 5-day trajectories that exhibit similar distributional, temporal, and cross-sectional characteristics to the real sequences.

Since the task focuses on short-horizon dynamics, models should capture the behaviour associated with week-long market cycles, including reactions to earnings reports, macroeconomic announcements, sector rotation, liquidity shocks, and changes in market sentiment.

Any generative architecture may be used (for example, diffusion models, GANs, VAE-based models, normalizing flows, or signature-based models), as long as the generated output follows the required trajectory dimensions.

**3. Dataset**

The dataset consists of daily closing prices for eight large publicly traded U.S. companies drawn from multiple sectors, representing a diverse cross-section of the equity market.
Raw prices are converted to log-returns to:
- normalize scale differences across equities,
- improve stationarity, and
- reflect percentage changes in asset value.

The time series are segmented using windows of length 5 with a stride of 2.
This design creates sequences that capture short-term market movements while keeping moderate overlap between windows to preserve statistical richness without excessive redundancy.

The dataset already includes:
- Train set
- Validation set
- Test set

Participants should develop and tune models using the train and validation splits.
The test set will not be provided; final ranking is based solely on performance on the held-out test set using the primary metric (HistogramMetric).

**4. Evaluation**

To evaluate the fidelity of generated equity log-return sequences, three metrics are used:

- HistogramMetric
  Measures distributional similarity between real and generated sequences by comparing empirical histograms of returns.

- CrossCorrelationMetric
  Compares lagged cross-stock correlation patterns, assessing whether sector-driven and market-wide co-movements are preserved.

- AutoCorrelationMetric
  Evaluates autocorrelation profiles within each equity, capturing short-horizon temporal dependencies and mild mean-reversion behaviour.

HistogramMetric serves as the primary ranking metric.
CrossCorrelationMetric and AutoCorrelationMetric provide insight into cross-sectional and temporal alignment.
Evaluation metric code for all three metrics will be provided to participants.

**5. Success Criteria**

A strong submission should:
- Achieve low discrepancy on HistogramMetric on the test set.
- Preserve cross-equity dependence patterns reflected by CrossCorrelationMetric
- Match short-horizon temporal characteristics measured by AutoCorrelationMetric.
- Generate stable, non-degenerate samples that avoid mode collapse, excessive smoothing, or unrealistic volatility patterns.

**6. Difficulty Level**

Difficulty: Easy

This task involves modelling short 5-day multivariate sequences with comparatively simple temporal dependencies and cross-sectional structure. The reduced horizon and lower volatility environment make it the most accessible of the three tasks.
