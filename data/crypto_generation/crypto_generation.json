    "description": "Task: Multivariate Generative Modelling of 24-Hour Cryptocurrency Log-Return Cycles \n\n**1. Task Overview**\n\nThis task evaluates a model\u2019s ability to generate realistic 24-step multivariate log-return sequences for a basket of major cryptocurrencies.  \nThe objective is to capture the distinctive dynamics of digital-asset markets, including high-frequency volatility bursts, cross-asset co-movement patterns, global timezone effects, and rapid sentiment-driven fluctuations.\n\nTask Type: Generative modelling  \nTrajectory Shape: [24, 10] log-return sequences  \n\n**2. Task Description**\n\nParticipants must develop a generative model capable of producing realistic 24-hour sequences of hourly log-returns across the following cryptoassets:\nADAUSDT, BNBUSDT, BTCUSDT, DOTUSDT, ETHUSDT, LINKUSDT, LTCUSDT, SOLUSDT, XLMUSDT, XRPUSDT.\n\nEach data sample is a 24-step rolling window of hourly log-returns over ten cryptocurrency pairs.  \nThe model should be able to generate synthetic 24-hour return cycles that reproduce the prominent features of crypto markets, such as sharp jumps following news releases, liquidity-driven regime shifts, rapid inter-asset transmission of shocks, and persistent short-horizon volatility patterns.\n\nAny generative architecture may be used, including diffusion models, GANs, flow-based models, autoregressive generators, or signature-based models, as long as the generated trajectories have the correct [24, 10] structure.\n\n**3. Dataset**\n\nThe dataset is derived from hourly price data covering several years of major cryptocurrency trading activity.  \nRaw prices are transformed into log-returns to normalize scale across assets and highlight proportional changes.\n\nThe time series is segmented into windows of length 24 using a stride of 4 hours.  \nThis design captures:\n- Full day-long segments reflecting the 24/7 nature of crypto markets,  \n- Overlapping windows sufficient for dense learning,  \n- Short-horizon behaviour including volatility clustering and rapid sentiment propagation.\n\nThe dataset contains:\n- Train set  \n- Validation set  \n- Test set  \n\nParticipants should develop and tune models using the train and validation splits.  \nThe test set will not be provided; final ranking is based solely on performance on the held-out test set using the primary metric (HistogramMetric).\n\n**4. Evaluation**\n\nGenerated output is compared to real crypto return sequences using three metrics:\n\n- HistogramMetric  \n  Measures distributional similarity between real and generated trajectories by comparing empirical histograms of returns.\n\n- CrossCorrelationMetric  \n  Measures lagged cross-asset correlation behaviour, ensuring the model captures instantaneous and short-lag co-movements across cryptoassets.\n\n- AutoCorrelationMetric  \n  Assesses the autocorrelation structure of individual crypto return series, reflecting short-range dependencies, volatility dynamics, and hourly return characteristics.\n\nHistogramMetric serves as the primary ranking metric.  \nCrossCorrelationMetric and AutoCorrelationMetric provide complementary evaluations of multivariate and temporal behaviour.  \nEvaluation metric code for all three metrics will be provided to participants.\n\n**5. Success Criteria**\n\nA strong submission should:\n- Achieve low discrepancy on HistogramMetric when generating 24-hour crypto return paths.  \n- Preserve realistic inter-asset correlation patterns as assessed by CrossCorrelationMetric.  \n- Reproduce short-horizon autocorrelation and volatility patterns indicated by AutoCorrelationMetric.  \n- Generate stable trajectories that avoid artefacts such as constant paths, unrealistic spikes, mode collapse, or excessively smooth behaviour.\n\n**6. Difficulty Level**\n\nDifficulty: Intermediate\n\nCryptocurrency markets exhibit pronounced non-stationarity, high volatility, rapid structural shifts, and strong cross-asset connectivity.  \nAccurately modelling these properties within a generative framework requires robust handling of multivariate short-horizon dynamics, non-Gaussian features, and rapidly evolving dependence structures across assets.",
