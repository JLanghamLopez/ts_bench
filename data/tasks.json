Task Overview**\n\nThis task evaluates a model\u2019s ability to forecast 5-day multivariate log-return sequences for nine major commodities, using the preceding 60 days of observations as input.  \nThe objective is to capture medium-term commodity-market dynamics influenced by seasonal behaviour, macroeconomic conditions, weather shocks, and cross-commodity linkages.\n\nTask Type: Forecasting  \nInput Shape: [60, 9] log-return sequences  \nTarget Shape: [5, 9] log-return sequences  \n\n**2. Task Description**\n\nParticipants must build a supervised forecasting model that takes as input 60 consecutive days of log-returns across the following commodities:\ngold, silver, copper, crude_oil_wti, crude_oil_brent, natural_gas, corn, wheat, soybeans.\n\nThe model must then predict the next 5 days of log-returns for the same nine assets.  \nEach supervised pair therefore consists of:\n- an input matrix of shape [60, 9],  \n- a target matrix of shape [5, 9].  \n\nThe forecasting problem requires capturing medium-horizon features such as:\n- persistent seasonal factors in energy and agricultural markets,  \n- macroeconomic news effects that propagate slowly across commodities,  \n- volatility clustering within metals and energy,  \n- cross-commodity spillovers (e.g., oil-price effects on agricultural inputs).\n\nAny forecasting architecture may be used, such as transformer models, sequence-to-sequence architectures, temporal convolutional networks, RNN-based models, or regression-style baselines, provided that outputs match the expected [5, 9] structure.\n\n**3. Dataset**\n\nThe dataset contains daily settlement prices converted into log-returns to normalize scale and provide a stationary representation across commodities with large differences in price levels.  \nEach supervised sample consists of a 60-day input window and a 5-day forecast horizon, offering roughly three months of information for predicting the subsequent week.\n\nThe dataset is split into:\n- Train set  \n- Validation set  \n- Test set  \n\nParticipants develop and tune models using the train and validation splits.  \nFinal evaluation and ranking rely exclusively on the test set.\n\n**4. Evaluation**\n\nForecast performance is measured using three metrics suited to multivariate commodity prediction:\n\n- RMSE  \n  Root mean squared error capturing magnitude-based forecast accuracy.\n\n- MAE  \n  Mean absolute error providing a robust error measure less affected by large spikes common in commodity markets.\n\n- QuantileLoss  \n  A pinball loss assessing accuracy of predictive distributions at selected quantiles, reflecting asymmetric risks and tail behaviours in commodity returns.\n\nRMSE is the primary ranking metric.\nMAE and QuantileLoss offer complementary assessments of robustness and probabilistic forecast quality.\n\n**5. Success Criteria**\n\nA strong submission should:\n- Achieve low RMSE, MAE, and QuantileLoss scores on the 5-day prediction horizon.  \n- Capture medium-term inter-commodity relationships, volatility regimes, and structural dependencies.  \n- Produce forecasts without excessive noise, drift, or systematic bias.  \n- Demonstrate stability across commodities with varied behaviours (e.g., energy vs. metals vs. agricultural assets).\n\n**6.
