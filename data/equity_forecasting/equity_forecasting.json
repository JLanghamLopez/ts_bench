    "description": "Task: Short-Horizon Multivariate Forecasting of U.S. Equity Log-Returns\n\n**1. Task Overview**\n\nThis task evaluates a model\u2019s ability to forecast 5-day multivariate log-return sequences for eight major U.S. equities, using the preceding 20 days of market behaviour as input.  \nThe objective is to predict short-horizon equity dynamics informed by recent volatility regimes, sector interactions, and firm-specific return characteristics.\n\nTask Type: Forecasting  \nInput Shape: [20, 8] log-return sequences  \nTarget Shape: [5, 8] log-return sequences  \n\n**2. Task Description**\n\nParticipants must build a supervised forecasting model that takes as input 20 consecutive days of log-returns across the following equities:\naapl, amzn, goog, jnj, jpm, meta, msft, nvda.\n\nThe model must then predict the next 5 days of log-returns for the same set of equities.  \nEach supervised training sample therefore consists of:\n- an input window of shape [20, 8],  \n- a target window of shape [5, 8].  \n\nThe task focuses on short-horizon prediction where models must capture patterns such as:\n- typical one-month volatility evolution,  \n- reactions to corporate earnings or macroeconomic events,  \n- sector-specific spillovers,  \n- correlation structure among the equities.\n\nAny forecasting architecture may be used, including transformer-based models, sequence-to-sequence networks, temporal convolutional models, RNN variants, or regression-based baselines, as long as outputs match the required [5, 8] format.\n\n**3. Dataset**\n\nThe dataset consists of daily closing prices for eight large U.S. equities.  \nRaw prices are transformed into log-returns to normalize scale and stabilise variance across sectors.\n\nEach sample is produced using a 20-day input window and a 5-day prediction horizon.  \nThe dataset is already partitioned into:\n- Train set  \n- Validation set  \n- Test set  \n\nParticipants should develop and tune models using the train and validation splits.  \nThe test set will not be provided; final ranking is based solely on performance on the held-out test set using the primary metric (RMSE).\n\n**4. Evaluation**\n\nForecast accuracy is evaluated using three metrics selected for short-horizon multivariate prediction:\n\n- RMSE  \n  Root mean squared error measuring magnitude accuracy of predicted log-returns.\n\n- MAE  \n  Mean absolute error providing a robust magnitude-based performance measure less sensitive to outliers.\n\n- MAPE  \n  Mean absolute percentage error providing a scale-normalised accuracy measure across equities with different volatility levels.\n\nRMSE is the primary ranking metric.  \nMAE and MAPE provide additional evaluations of robustness and scale-adjusted forecast performance.  \nEvaluation metric code for RMSE, MAE, and MAPE will be provided to participants.\n\n**5. Success Criteria**\n\nA strong submission should:\n- Achieve low values on RMSE, MAE, and MAPE for the 5-day prediction horizon.  \n- Capture short-term cross-sectional and temporal relationships among equities.  \n- Produce stable predictions without excessive noise, drift, or mode collapse.  \n- Perform reliably across equities from different sectors.\n\n**6. Difficulty Level**\n\nDifficulty: Easy\n\nThe relatively short input window and more stable market structure make this task suitable as an accessible entry point for multivariate financial forecasting.",
