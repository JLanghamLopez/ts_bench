Task: Short-Horizon Multivariate Forecasting of U.S. Equity Log-Returns

**1. Task Overview**

This task evaluates a model’s ability to forecast 5-day multivariate log-return sequences for eight major U.S. equities, using the preceding 20 days of market behaviour as input.
The objective is to predict short-horizon equity dynamics informed by recent volatility regimes, sector interactions, and firm-specific return characteristics.

Task Type: Forecasting
Input Shape: [20, 8] log-return sequences
Target Shape: [5, 8] log-return sequences

**2. Task Description**

Participants must build a supervised forecasting model that takes as input 20 consecutive days of log-returns across the following equities:
aapl, amzn, goog, jnj, jpm, meta, msft, nvda.

The model must then predict the next 5 days of log-returns for the same set of equities.
Each supervised training sample therefore consists of:
- an input window of shape [20, 8],
- a target window of shape [5, 8].

The task focuses on short-horizon prediction where models must capture patterns such as:
- typical one-month volatility evolution,
- reactions to corporate earnings or macroeconomic events,
- sector-specific spillovers,
- correlation structure among the equities.

Any forecasting architecture may be used, including transformer-based models, sequence-to-sequence networks, temporal convolutional models, RNN variants, or regression-based baselines, as long as outputs match the required [5, 8] format.

**3. Dataset**

The dataset consists of daily closing prices for eight large U.S. equities.
Raw prices are transformed into log-returns to normalize scale and stabilise variance across sectors.

Each sample is produced using a 20-day input window and a 5-day prediction horizon.
The dataset is already partitioned into:
- Train set
- Validation set
- Test set

Participants should develop and tune models using the train and validation splits.
The test set will not be provided; final ranking is based solely on performance on the held-out test set using the primary metric (RMSE).

**4. Evaluation**

Forecast accuracy is evaluated using three metrics selected for short-horizon multivariate prediction:

- RMSE
  Root mean squared error measuring magnitude accuracy of predicted log-returns.

- MAE
  Mean absolute error providing a robust magnitude-based performance measure less sensitive to outliers.

- MAPE
  Mean absolute percentage error providing a scale-normalised accuracy measure across equities with different volatility levels.

RMSE is the primary ranking metric.
MAE and MAPE provide additional evaluations of robustness and scale-adjusted forecast performance.
Evaluation metric code for RMSE, MAE, and MAPE will be provided to participants.

**5. Success Criteria**

A strong submission should:
- Achieve low values on RMSE, MAE, and MAPE for the 5-day prediction horizon.
- Capture short-term cross-sectional and temporal relationships among equities.
- Produce stable predictions without excessive noise, drift, or mode collapse.
- Perform reliably across equities from different sectors.

**6. Difficulty Level**

Difficulty: Easy

The relatively short input window and more stable market structure make this task suitable as an accessible entry point for multivariate financial forecasting.
