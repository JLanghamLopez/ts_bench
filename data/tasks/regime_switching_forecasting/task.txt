Task: Regime-switching Financial Time-Series Forecasting

**1. Task Overview**

The limited availability of financial and economic data is a major bottleneck for the effective
application of machine learning methods in finance. Forecasting models trained on financial time
series must handle strong non-stationarity, low signal-to-noise ratios, and abrupt structural
changes that often reflect regime shifts such as periods of market stress.

Accurate short- to medium-horizon forecasting of multivariate price–volatility dynamics is
important for risk management, scenario analysis, and trading. In regime-switching environments,
models must remain robust under both stable and elevated-volatility episodes and should preserve
cross-asset relationships rather than fitting only marginal trends.

This task focuses on forecasting the near-future evolution of a multivariate financial system by
learning from historical trajectories that implicitly contain multiple market regimes.

**2. Task Description**

In this competition, participants are challenged to construct a forecasting model that predicts
the next two time steps of a multivariate financial time series given the preceding history.

Each sample trajectory represents the joint evolution of price and volatility processes for two
financial instruments over 20 time steps. For the forecasting task, each trajectory is split into:

- an input context window of the first 18 time steps, and
- a prediction target horizon of the final 2 time steps.

Models are expected to learn medium-horizon temporal structure, handle regime-dependent dynamics
(without explicit regime labels), and preserve cross-variable and cross-asset dependence in their
forecasts. Any forecasting approach may be used, including classical time-series models, machine
learning regressors, deep learning sequence models, or hybrid methods, provided that outputs conform
to the required format.

**3. Dataset**

Participants will be provided with pre-split NumPy datasets derived from the original regime-switching
trajectories. The original data consist of multivariate sample paths with shape [N, 20, 4], where each
trajectory contains 20 time steps, and 4 channels corresponding to price and volatility variables for
two financial instruments.

For this forecasting task, the following the data are split into input–target pairs as follows:
- Training inputs: train_X.npy with shape [20000, 18, 4]
  The first 18 time steps of each training trajectory.

- Training targets: train_Y.npy with shape [20000, 2, 4]
  The final 2 time steps to be forecasted.

- Test inputs: test_X.npy with shape [2000, 18, 4]
  The first 18 time steps of each test trajectory.

A held-out test target set (corresponding to the final 2 time steps) is used for evaluation and is not
provided to participants. Final ranking is based solely on performance on this held-out test set using
all evaluation metrics.

**4. Evaluation**

Forecast performance is evaluated using the following metrics:

- RMSE
  Root mean squared error measuring overall forecast accuracy.

- MAE
  Mean absolute error providing a stable magnitude-based measure.

- MAPE
  Mean absolute percentage error offering a scale-normalised comparison.

Evaluation code for all metrics will be provided.

**5. Submission**

Participants must return its forecasts as a JSON-serialized Python object (nested lists),
representing the prediction array. The file must contain model forecasts corresponding to
the test inputs and must have the shape [2000, 2, 4].

A strong submission should:
- Achieve low RMSE, MAE, and MAPE on the 2-day forecast horizon.
- Produce stable forecasts without systematic drift or excessive noise.

**6. Difficulty Level**

Difficulty: Advanced

Although the forecast horizon is short, the underlying trajectories exhibit regime-switching behaviour
and heterogeneous volatility patterns. Successful models must generalise across both stable and stressed
regimes and preserve multivariate dependence structures, making the task substantially more challenging
than standard stationary forecasting benchmarks.
