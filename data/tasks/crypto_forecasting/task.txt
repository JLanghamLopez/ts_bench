Task: Crypto Market Intraday Log-Return Forecasting

**1. Task Overview**

Cryptocurrency markets operate continuously without circuit breakers or overnight closures. 
This 24/7 environment, together with rapidly changing liquidity conditions, leads to pronounced 
short-horizon volatility and shifting dependence structures across assets. Reliable intraday 
forecasting is therefore both challenging and practically important for risk monitoring, hedging, 
and algorithmic decision-making.

This task evaluates a model’s ability to forecast multivariate intraday log-return trajectories 
for a small set of highly liquid cryptocurrencies. Participants must predict the near-future evolution 
of hourly log-returns, capturing volatility dynamics and cross-asset relationships under relatively 
stable macroeconomic conditions.

**2. Task Description**

Participants are required to build and train a forecasting model that predicts the next 4 hourly 
log-return steps for three major cryptocurrencies, conditioned on the preceding 20 hours of observed 
log-returns.

Each data sample represents one 24-hour window of hourly log-returns observed simultaneously across 
the three assets. For forecasting, each 24-hour trajectory is split into an input context window 
consisting of the first 20 hourly time steps, and a prediction target horizon consisting of the 
final 4 hourly time steps.

Models should learn short-horizon temporal patterns (e.g., volatility clustering), handle noisy 
return dynamics, and preserve cross-asset dependence in the forecast horizon. Any forecasting 
approach may be used, including classical time-series models, machine learning methods, deep 
learning sequence models, or hybrid approaches, provided that the outputs conform exactly to 
the required format.

**3. Dataset**

The dataset consists of historical hourly log-return data for three of the most actively traded 
cryptocurrencies, spanning multiple years. To reduce the impact of extreme market regimes, periods 
associated with the COVID-19 crisis and large-scale quantitative easing have been excluded. 
The time series are segmented into overlapping 24-hour samples using a rolling window approach.

For the forecasting task, participants are provided with the following pre-split NumPy datasets:
Training inputs: train_X.npy, shape [7150, 20, 3]
Training targets: train_Y.npy, shape [7150, 4, 3]
Test inputs: test_X.npy, shape [1787, 20, 3]

A held-out test target set (corresponding to the final 4 hours) is used for evaluation and is not 
provided to participants. Final ranking is based solely on performance on this held-out test set 
using all evaluation metrics.

**4. Evaluation**

Forecast performance is evaluated using the following metrics:

- RMSE
  Root mean squared error measuring overall forecast accuracy.

- MAE
  Mean absolute error providing a stable magnitude-based measure.

- MAPE
  Mean absolute percentage error offering a scale-normalised comparison.

Evaluation code for all metrics will be provided.

**5. Submission**

Participants must return its forecasts as a JSON-serialized Python object (nested lists), 
representing the prediction array. The file must contain model forecasts corresponding to 
the test inputs and must have the shape [1787, 4, 3].

**6. Difficulty Level**
