Task: Regime-switching Financial Time-Series Generation

**1. Task Overview**

The limited availability of financial and economic data is a major bottleneck for the effective application of 
machine learning methods in finance. High-fidelity synthetic data generation provides a promising approach to 
augment existing datasets while preserving statistical properties and protecting data privacy. Recent advances 
in generative modelling, including GANs, VAEs, and diffusion-based models, have shown strong potential in this area.

Financial time series exhibit distinctive challenges, such as strong time heterogeneity, low signal-to-noise ratios, 
and abrupt structural changes. In particular, asset price and volatility dynamics often behave very differently 
uring periods of market stress compared to economically stable regimes. These regime shifts are commonly associated 
with events such as financial crises, pandemics, or major policy interventions.

This task focuses on developing generative models that can faithfully reproduce multivariate financial time series
exhibiting regime-switching behaviour. Robust solutions are expected to capture both normal and high-volatility 
regimes and the transitions between them.


**2. Task Description**

In this competition, participants are challenged to construct a generative model capable of producing synthetic
financial time series that closely mimic the joint distribution of price and volatility processes for multiple 
financial instruments.

The training data consist of short multivariate trajectories that reflect different market regimes, including 
low-volatility and high-volatility episodes. These regimes are not explicitly labelled; instead, regime characteristics 
must be inferred implicitly from the observed dynamics. Participants may employ any generative modelling approach, 
including but not limited to GAN-based models, variational autoencoders, diffusion models, or other sequence-based 
generators. Generated samples should reproduce realistic temporal dynamics, cross-variable relationships, and 
regime-dependent behaviour observed in the real data.

**3. Dataset**

The participants will be provided with the training dataset (train.npy) It consists of 20,000 sample trajectories, 
each representing the joint evolution of price and volatility for two financial instruments over a fixed time horizon.

Training Dataset shape:[20000, 20, 4]

Interpretation:
- 20 time steps per trajectory
- 4 channels corresponding to price and volatility variables for the two assets

The dataset exhibits heterogeneous dynamics arising from different market regimes, including periods of elevated 
volatility and more stable behaviour. No explicit regime labels are provided.

Final ranking is based solely on performance on the held-out test set using all evaluation metrics.

**4. Evaluation**

Models will be evaluated by comparing generated trajectories to real test trajectories using three metrics:

- HistogramMetric
  Measures distributional similarity between real and generated trajectories by comparing empirical histograms of returns.

- CrossCorrelationMetric
  Compares lagged cross-correlations between commodities, assessing whether inter-market temporal dependencies are preserved.

- AutoCorrelationMetric
  Evaluates within-series autocorrelation patterns, capturing temporal persistence and volatility behaviour of individual commodity return processes.

Evaluation metric code for all three metrics will be provided to participants.

**5. Submission**

Participants must submit their generated samples as a JSON-serialized Python object (nested lists) representing the synthetic time series array.

The submission must have the following shape: [2000, 20, 4]

A successful submission should:
- Achieve low discrepancy on HistogramMetric on the test set.
- Preserve cross-commodity temporal dependence patterns reflected by CrossCorrelationMetric.
- Match temporal persistence and volatility characteristics measured by AutoCorrelationMetric.
- Produce stable and realistic trajectories without obvious artefacts or mode collapse.
