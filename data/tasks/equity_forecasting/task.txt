Task: Short-Horizon Forecasting of U.S. Equity Return–Volatility Dynamics

**1. Task Overview**

Financial time series are characterised by non-stationarity, heavy tails, and complex 
cross-asset interactions. Even under regular market conditions, forecasting short-horizon 
dynamics of returns and volatility remains challenging due to low signal-to-noise ratios 
and evolving dependence structures.

This task focuses on short-horizon forecasting of multivariate financial time series under 
normal market conditions. Participants are asked to predict the near-future evolution of 
return and volatility dynamics for multiple correlated U.S. equities, using recent historical 
observations as input.

**2. Task Description**

In this competition, participants are challenged to construct a forecasting model that 
predicts the next trading day’s return–volatility vector given the recent history.

Each sample represents the joint daily return and volatility dynamics of five correlated 
U.S. equities over a short horizon. For forecasting, each trajectory is split into:

- an input context window consisting of the first 4 daily observations, and
- a prediction target horizon consisting of the final 1 daily observation.

Models are expected to learn short-horizon temporal dependencies and cross-equity 
relationships present in the data. Any forecasting approach may be used, including 
classical time-series models, machine learning regressors, deep learning sequence models, 
or hybrid approaches, provided that outputs conform to the required format.

**3. Dataset**

Participants are provided with preprocessed NumPy arrays corresponding to input–target 
splits derived from historical financial time series under normal market conditions.

Training inputs: train_X.npy
Shape: [870, 4, 10]
Represents the first 4 daily observations of each training trajectory.

Training targets: train_Y.npy
Shape: [870, 1, 10]
Represents the next-day return and volatility values to be forecasted.

Test inputs: test_X.npy
Shape: [217, 4, 10]
Represents the first 4 daily observations of each test trajectory.

Each time step contains 10 features corresponding to daily return and volatility measures 
for five correlated equities. The test targets are held out and used exclusively for evaluation.

**4. Evaluation**

Forecast performance is evaluated using the following metrics:

- RMSE
  Root mean squared error measuring overall forecast accuracy.

- MAE
  Mean absolute error providing a stable magnitude-based measure.

- MAPE
  Mean absolute percentage error offering a scale-normalised comparison.

Evaluation code for all metrics will be provided.

**5. Submission**

Participants must return its forecasts as a JSON-serialized Python object (nested lists), 
representing the prediction array. The file must contain model forecasts corresponding to 
the test inputs and must have the shape of [217, 1, 10].

**6. Difficulty Level**
