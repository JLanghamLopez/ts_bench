Task: Short-Horizon Multivariate Forecasting of U.S. Equity Log-Returns

**1. Task Overview**

This task evaluates a model’s ability to forecast 5-day multivariate log-return sequences for eight major U.S. equities, using the preceding 24 trading days as input.
The objective is to model short-horizon equity return dynamics under recent market conditions.

Task Type: Forecasting
Input Shape: [24, 8] log-return sequences
Target Shape: [5, 8] log-return sequences

**2. Task Description**

Participants are required to build a supervised forecasting model that takes as input 24 consecutive days of log-returns for the following equities:
aapl, amzn, goog, jnj, jpm, meta, msft, nvda.

The model must predict the subsequent 5 days of log-returns for the same set of equities.
Each supervised sample consists of:
- an input window of shape [24, 8],
- a target window of shape [5, 8].

The task focuses on short-horizon forecasting, where models are expected to capture patterns such as:
- short-term volatility evolution,
- reactions to corporate earnings or macroeconomic announcements,
- sector-level spillovers,
- cross-sectional correlation structure among equities.

Any forecasting architecture may be used, including transformer-based models, recurrent networks, temporal convolutional models, or regression-style baselines, provided that outputs conform to the required [5, 8] format.

**3. Dataset**

The dataset is constructed from daily closing prices of eight large U.S. equities spanning the period 2012-05-18 to 2024-12-30, transformed into log-returns.
Data are organised into supervised samples using a 24-day input window and a 5-day forecast horizon.

Predefined splits are provided:
- Train set
- Validation set
- Test set

Models should be trained and tuned using the training and validation sets.
Final evaluation is performed on the held-out test set using the primary metric (RMSE).

**4. Evaluation**

Forecast performance is evaluated using the following metrics:

- RMSE
  Root mean squared error measuring overall forecast accuracy.

- MAE
  Mean absolute error providing a stable magnitude-based measure.

- MAPE
  Mean absolute percentage error offering a scale-normalised comparison across equities.

RMSE is used for final ranking.
Evaluation code for all metrics will be provided.

**5. Success Criteria**

A strong submission should:
- Achieve low RMSE, MAE, and MAPE on the 5-day forecast horizon.
- Produce stable predictions without systematic drift or excessive noise.
- Reflect short-term cross-sectional and temporal relationships present in the data.

**6. Difficulty Level**

Difficulty: Easy

The short forecast horizon and moderate input window make this task suitable as an accessible entry point for multivariate equity return forecasting.
