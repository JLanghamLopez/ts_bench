Task: Multivariate Forecasting of Major FX Log-Return Dynamics

**1. Task Overview**

This task evaluates a model’s ability to forecast 5-day multivariate log-return sequences for seven major foreign-exchange pairs, using the preceding 24 trading days as input.
The aim is to model short- to medium-horizon FX return dynamics under evolving macroeconomic and cross-currency conditions.

Task Type: Forecasting
Input Shape: [24, 7] log-return sequences
Target Shape: [5, 7] log-return sequences

**2. Task Description**

Participants are required to develop a supervised forecasting model that takes as input 24 consecutive days of log-returns for the following currency pairs:
EUR_USD, GBP_USD, USD_JPY, USD_CNY, AUD_USD, USD_CHF, USD_CAD.

The model must produce forecasts for the subsequent 5 days of log-returns for the same set of currency pairs.
Each supervised sample consists of:
- an input matrix of shape [24, 7],
- a target matrix of shape [5, 7].

The task focuses on learning temporal and cross-sectional patterns commonly observed in FX markets, including:
- interest-rate–related adjustments,
- policy divergence across currency blocs,
- cross-currency risk transmission,
- changes in global risk conditions.

Any forecasting approach may be used, including transformer-based models, recurrent architectures, temporal convolutional models, or regression-based baselines, provided that outputs conform to the required [5, 7] format.

**3. Dataset**

The dataset is derived from daily foreign-exchange rates spanning the period 2006-05-16 to 2025-11-28, transformed into log-returns.
The raw exchange-rate data were retrieved from Yahoo Finance using the open-source yfinance Python library.

Data are organised into supervised learning samples using a 24-day input window and a 5-day forecast horizon.

The following files are provided to participants:
- Train set (train_X.npy, train_Y.npy)
- Validation set (val_X.npy, val_Y.npy)
- Test set (test_X.npy)

Models should be trained and tuned exclusively on the training and validation sets.
Final evaluation is performed on the held-out test set (test_Y) using all evaluation metrics.

**4. Evaluation**

Forecast performance is evaluated using the following metrics:

- RMSE
  Root mean squared error measuring overall forecast accuracy.

- MAE
  Mean absolute error providing a robust measure less sensitive to extreme observations.

- MAPE
  Mean absolute percentage error offering a scale-normalised comparison across currency pairs.

Evaluation code for all metrics will be provided.

**5. Submission**

Participants must return its forecasts as a JSON-serialized Python object (nested lists), representing the prediction array.
The file must contain model forecasts corresponding to the test inputs and must have the same number of samples and ordering as test_X.npy.

A strong submission should:
- Achieve low RMSE, MAE, and MAPE over the 5-day forecast horizon.
- Produce stable forecasts without systematic drift or excessive noise.
- Reflect cross-currency relationships and temporal patterns present in the input data.

**6. Difficulty Level**

Difficulty: Intermediate

The task requires learning multivariate temporal structure and cross-currency dependencies over a moderate forecasting horizon.
