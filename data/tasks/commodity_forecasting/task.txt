Task: Medium-Horizon Multivariate Forecasting of Commodity Log-Returns

**1. Task Overview**

This task evaluates a model’s ability to forecast 5-day multivariate log-return sequences for nine major commodities, using the preceding 60 trading days as input.
The aim is to model medium-horizon return dynamics commonly observed in commodity markets.

Task Type: Forecasting
Input Shape: [60, 9] log-return sequences
Target Shape: [5, 9] log-return sequences

**2. Task Description**

Participants are required to build a supervised forecasting model that takes as input 60 consecutive days of log-returns for the following commodities:
gold, silver, copper, crude_oil_wti, crude_oil_brent, natural_gas, corn, wheat, soybeans.

The model must predict the subsequent 5 days of log-returns for the same set of commodities.
Each supervised sample consists of:
- an input matrix of shape [60, 9],
- a target matrix of shape [5, 9].

The task focuses on medium-horizon forecasting, where models are expected to learn patterns such as:
- recurring seasonal effects in energy and agricultural markets,
- gradual adjustment to macroeconomic information,
- persistence in volatility levels,
- dependence between related commodity markets.

Any forecasting architecture may be used, including transformer-based models, recurrent networks, temporal convolutional models, or regression-style baselines, provided that outputs conform to the required [5, 9] format.

**3. Dataset**

The dataset is constructed from daily settlement prices of nine major commodity futures spanning the period 2007-07-30 to 2025-11-28.
The raw price data were retrieved from Yahoo Finance using the open-source yfinance Python library.
The original price series were transformed into log-returns and organised into supervised learning samples using a 60-day input window and a 5-day forecast horizon, and subsequently split into training, validation, and test sets.

The following files are provided to participants:
- Train set (train_X.npy, train_Y.npy)
- Validation set (val_X.npy, val_Y.npy)
- Test set (test_X.npy)

Models should be trained and tuned exclusively on the training and validation sets.
Final evaluation is performed on the held-out test set (test_Y.npy) using all evaluation metrics.

**4. Evaluation**

Forecast performance is evaluated using the following metrics:

- RMSE
  Root mean squared error measuring overall forecast accuracy.

- MAE
  Mean absolute error providing a robust measure under periods of elevated volatility.

- MAPE
  Mean absolute percentage error offering a scale-normalised comparison across commodities.

Evaluation code for all metrics will be provided.

**5. Submission**

Participants must submit a single NumPy file named submission.npy with floating-point values.
The file must contain model forecasts corresponding to the test inputs and must have the same number of samples and ordering as test_X.npy.

A strong submission should:
- Achieve low RMSE, MAE, and MAPE on the 5-day forecast horizon.
- Produce stable forecasts without systematic drift or excessive noise.
- Reflect medium-horizon temporal patterns and cross-commodity relationships present in the data.

**6. Difficulty Level**

Difficulty: Advanced

The long conditioning window and medium-horizon forecast horizon require models to capture both temporal structure and cross-commodity dependence across diverse market conditions.
