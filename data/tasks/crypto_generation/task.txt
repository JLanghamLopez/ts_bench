Task: Crypto Market Log-Return Simulation

**1. Task Overview**

This task evaluates a model’s ability to generate multivariate intraday log-return trajectories over a 24-hour horizon
for a small set of highly liquid cryptocurrencies. The objective is to model short-horizon return behaviour observed
in continuous cryptocurrency markets, including volatility dynamics and cross-asset dependence, under relatively stable
macroeconomic conditions.

**2. Task Description**

Participants are required to train a generative model that produces intraday log-return trajectories for three highly
traded cryptocurrencies. Each data sample represents one trading day and consists of 24 consecutive hourly log-returns
observed simultaneously across the three assets.

The training data are constructed using a rolling window approach applied to historical market data. Each window is
treated as an independent sample drawn from an unknown underlying distribution of daily return trajectories.
The modelling objective is to learn this distribution and to generate new synthetic samples that are indistinguishable
from real data in terms of their statistical and temporal properties.

Any generative modelling approach may be used, including diffusion-based models, GANs, flow-based models, autoregressive
generators, or other sequence-based methods. Regardless of the modelling choice, generated outputs must have the exact
shape [24,3] and reflect realistic intraday behaviour, including variability over time and dependence between assets.

**3. Dataset**

The dataset consists of historical hourly log-return data for three of the most actively traded cryptocurrencies,
spanning more than seven years. To reduce the impact of extreme market regimes, periods associated with the COVID-19
crisis and large-scale quantitative easing have been excluded. The time series are segmented into overlapping 24-hour
samples using a rolling window approach.

Only the training dataset (train_log_return.npy) will be provided to participants, which has shape (7150, 24, 3).
Final evaluation is performed on the held-out test set using all evaluation metrics.

**4. Evaluation**

Generated trajectories are evaluated by comparison with real test trajectories using the following metrics:

- HistogramMetric
  Measures the similarity between real and generated time series by comparing their empirical marginal distributions.

- CrossCorrelationMetric
  Evaluates whether dependence structures across different dimensions of the time series are preserved.

- AutoCorrelationMetric
  Assesses temporal dependence within individual time series components.

Evaluation code for all metrics will be provided.

**5. Submission**

Participants must return 1787 generated multivariate time series samples as a JSON-serialized Python object (nested lists) with shape [1787, 24, 3].

A strong submission should:
- Achieve low discrepancy on HistogramMetric on the test set.
- Preserve cross-asset dependence as measured by CrossCorrelationMetric.
- Match short-horizon temporal behaviour reflected by AutoCorrelationMetric.
- Produce stable trajectories without obvious artefacts.

**6. Difficulty Level**

Difficulty: Intermediate

The task focuses on modelling short-horizon multivariate return dynamics for a small number of assets under relatively stable market conditions. While temporal and cross-sectional dependence must be captured, the reduced dimensionality and absence of regime extremes make the problem more accessible than large-scale, high-dimensional financial generative modelling tasks.
