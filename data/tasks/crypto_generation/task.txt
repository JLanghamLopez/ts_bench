Task: Multivariate Generative Modelling of 24-Hour Cryptocurrency Log-Return Trajectories

**1. Task Overview**

This task evaluates a model’s ability to generate multivariate log-return trajectories over a 24-hour horizon for a set of major cryptocurrencies.
The aim is to model short-horizon return behaviour observed in continuous cryptocurrency markets, including volatility variation and cross-asset dependence.

Task Type: Generative modelling
Trajectory Shape: [24, 10] log-return sequences

**2. Task Description**

Participants are required to train a generative model capable of producing 24-step sequences of hourly log-returns for the following cryptoassets:
ADAUSDT, BNBUSDT, BTCUSDT, DOTUSDT, ETHUSDT, LINKUSDT, LTCUSDT, SOLUSDT, XLMUSDT, XRPUSDT.

Each data sample consists of a rolling window of 24 consecutive hourly log-returns across the ten assets.
After training, the model should be able to generate new trajectories with the same dimensional structure and with statistical and temporal properties comparable to those observed in the data.

Any generative modelling approach may be used, including diffusion-based models, GANs, flow-based models, autoregressive generators, or other sequence-based methods, provided that generated outputs conform to the required [24, 10] format.

**3. Dataset**

The dataset is derived from hourly cryptocurrency price data spanning the period
2021-01-01 00:00:00+00:00 to 2024-12-31 23:00:00+00:00, transformed into log-returns.
The raw price data were retrieved programmatically from the Binance exchange via its public API, using the open-source ccxt Python library.

The time series are segmented into overlapping windows of length 24 hours using a stride of 4 hours.

The following files are provided to participants:
- Train set (train.npy)
- Validation set (val.npy)

Models should be trained and tuned using the training and validation sets.
Final evaluation is performed on the held-out test set using all evaluation metrics.

**4. Evaluation**

Generated trajectories are evaluated by comparison with real test trajectories using the following metrics:

- HistogramMetric
  Measures similarity between empirical distributions of real and generated log-returns.

- CrossCorrelationMetric
  Evaluates whether cross-asset dependence patterns are preserved.

- AutoCorrelationMetric
  Assesses short-horizon temporal dependence within individual return series.

Evaluation code for all metrics will be provided.

**5. Submission**

Participants must return 876 generated multivariate time series samples as a JSON-serialized Python object (nested lists) with shape [876, 24, 10].

A strong submission should:
- Achieve low discrepancy on HistogramMetric on the test set.
- Preserve cross-asset dependence as measured by CrossCorrelationMetric.
- Match short-horizon temporal behaviour reflected by AutoCorrelationMetric.
- Produce stable trajectories without obvious artefacts.

**6. Difficulty Level**

Difficulty: Intermediate

The task involves modelling short-horizon multivariate return dynamics under continuous trading conditions with heterogeneous volatility across assets.
