Task: Short-Horizon Generative Modelling of U.S. Equity Return–Volatility Dynamics

**1. Task Overview**

Financial time series often exhibit non-stationarity, heavy tails, and complex temporal dependence, 
making realistic data-driven modelling a challenging task. In many practical applications, the availability 
of high-quality financial data is limited, which restricts the performance of downstream machine learning models.

Synthetic data generation offers a promising solution by enabling the creation of artificial time series that 
preserve the statistical characteristics of real data while mitigating data scarcity and privacy concerns. 
This task focuses on the unconditional generation of financial time series under regular market conditions.
Participants are asked to develop generative models that can produce realistic multivariate financial time series 
reflecting normal market dynamics, without conditioning on explicit regime labels.

**2. Task Description**

In this competition, participants are challenged to construct and train an unconditional generative model capable of 
simulating synthetic financial time series that closely approximate the distribution of real data observed under 
normal market conditions.

Each generated sample should represent the joint evolution of daily returns and volatility for multiple financial assets 
over a short time horizon. The objective is to reproduce realistic temporal dynamics and cross-asset relationships present 
in the training data.

Any generative modelling approach may be used, including GANs, variational autoencoders, diffusion models, or other 
sequence-based generators, provided that the generated outputs match the required data format.

**3. Dataset**

The dataset consists of historical financial time series representing daily return and volatility dynamics under normal 
market conditions. All samples corresponding to crisis periods have been removed to focus exclusively on regular market 
behaviour. The time series represent the joint evolution of five correlated financial assets over a short horizon. 
Each sample corresponds to a fixed-length trajectory and is treated as an independent observation drawn from the underlying
data-generating process.

Only the training dataset will be provided to participants:
File: train.npy
Shape: [870, 5, 10]
Description:
- 870 sample trajectories
- 5 time steps per trajectory (daily observations)
- 10 features per time step, corresponding to return and volatility measures for the 5 assets

Final evaluation is performed on the held-out test set using all evaluation metrics.

**4. Evaluation**

Generated trajectories are evaluated by comparing samples from the model to real test trajectories using the following metrics:

- HistogramMetric
  Measures the similarity between real and generated time series by comparing their empirical marginal distributions.

- CrossCorrelationMetric
  Evaluates whether dependence structures across different dimensions of the time series are preserved.

- AutoCorrelationMetric
  Assesses temporal dependence within individual time series components.

Evaluation code for all metrics will be provided.

**5. Submission**

Participants must return 217 generated multivariate time series samples as a JSON-serialized Python object (nested lists) with shape [217, 5, 10].

A strong submission should:
- Achieve low discrepancy on HistogramMetric on the test set.
- Preserve cross-equity dependence patterns.
- Match short-term temporal behaviour observed in the data.
- Produce stable trajectories without artefacts or mode collapse.

**6. Difficulty Level**
