Task: Short-Horizon Multivariate Generative Modelling of U.S. Equity Log-Return Trajectories

**1. Task Overview**

This task evaluates a model’s ability to generate realistic short-horizon multivariate log-return trajectories for eight major U.S. equities.
The goal is to reproduce short-term equity return behaviour under recent market conditions, including volatility patterns and cross-sectional dependence.

Task Type: Generative modelling
Trajectory Shape: [5, 8] log-return sequences

**2. Task Description**

Participants are required to train a generative model capable of producing realistic 5-day trajectories of daily log-returns for the following equities:
aapl, amzn, goog, jnj, jpm, meta, msft, nvda.

Each data sample consists of a window of 5 consecutive daily log-returns across these eight equities.
The trained model should be able to generate new trajectories with the same shape and with statistical and temporal properties comparable to those observed in the real data.

Any generative architecture may be used, including diffusion-based models, GANs, normalizing flows, or other sequence generative approaches, provided that generated outputs match the required [5, 8] format.

**3. Dataset**

The dataset is constructed from daily closing prices of eight large U.S. equities spanning the period 2012-05-18 to 2024-12-30, transformed into log-returns.
The time series are segmented into overlapping windows using a window length of 5 trading days and a stride of 2 days.

The following files are provided to participants:
- Train set (train.npy)
- Validation set (val.npy)

Models should be trained and tuned exclusively on the training and validation sets.
Final evaluation is performed on the held-out test set using all evaluation metrics.

**4. Evaluation**

Generated trajectories are evaluated by comparing samples from the model to real test trajectories using the following metrics:

- HistogramMetric
  Measures similarity between empirical distributions of real and generated log-returns.

- CrossCorrelationMetric
  Evaluates whether cross-sectional dependence between equities is preserved.

- AutoCorrelationMetric
  Assesses short-term temporal dependence within individual equity return series.

Evaluation code for all metrics will be provided.

**5. Submission**

Participants must submit a single NumPy file named submission.npy containing floating-point values with shape [159, 5, 8], corresponding to 159 generated multivariate time series samples.

A strong submission should:
- Achieve low discrepancy on HistogramMetric on the test set.
- Preserve cross-equity dependence patterns.
- Match short-term temporal behaviour observed in the data.
- Produce stable trajectories without artefacts or mode collapse.

**6. Difficulty Level**

Difficulty: Easy

The short trajectory length and limited temporal horizon make this task suitable as an accessible entry point for multivariate generative modelling of equity returns.
