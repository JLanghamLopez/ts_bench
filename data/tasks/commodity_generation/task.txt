Task: Multivariate Generative Modelling of Commodity Log-Return Trajectories

**1. Task Overview**

This task evaluates a model’s ability to generate realistic 60-day multivariate log-return trajectories for nine major commodities.
The goal is to reproduce medium-term market behaviour, including volatility patterns, cross-market co-movements, and risk-sensitive characteristics of the joint distribution.

Task Type: Generative modelling
Trajectory Shape: [60, 9] log-return sequences

**2. Task Description**

Participants must train a generative model capable of producing realistic 60-day paths of daily log-returns across the following commodities:
gold, silver, copper, crude_oil_wti, crude_oil_brent, natural_gas, corn, wheat, and soybeans.

Each data sample is a window of 60 consecutive daily log-returns across these nine commodities.
The trained model should be able to generate new trajectories with the same shape and comparable statistical and temporal properties to those observed in the real data.

Any generative architecture may be used (for example, diffusion models, GANs, normalizing flows, or signature-based models), provided that the generated output matches the required dimensions and format.

**3. Dataset**

The dataset consists of multivariate log-return time series constructed from daily settlement prices of nine major commodity futures spanning the period 2007-07-30 to 2025-11-28.
The raw price data were retrieved from Yahoo Finance using the open-source yfinance Python library.

The following files are provided to participants:
- Train set (train.npy)
- Validation set (val.npy)

Models should be trained and tuned exclusively on the training and validation sets.
Final ranking is based solely on performance on the held-out test set (test.npy) using all evaluation metrics.

**4. Evaluation**

Models will be evaluated by comparing generated trajectories to real test trajectories using three metrics:

- HistogramMetric
  Measures distributional similarity between real and generated trajectories by comparing empirical histograms of returns.

- CrossCorrelationMetric
  Compares lagged cross-correlations between commodities, assessing whether inter-market temporal dependencies are preserved.

- AutoCorrelationMetric
  Evaluates within-series autocorrelation patterns, capturing temporal persistence and volatility behaviour of individual commodity return processes.

Evaluation metric code for all three metrics will be provided to participants.

**5. Submission**

Participants must submit a single NumPy file named submission.npy containing floating-point values with shape [91, 60, 9], corresponding to 91 generated multivariate time series samples.

A successful submission should:
- Achieve low discrepancy on HistogramMetric on the test set.
- Preserve cross-commodity temporal dependence patterns reflected by CrossCorrelationMetric.
- Match temporal persistence and volatility characteristics measured by AutoCorrelationMetric.
- Produce stable and realistic trajectories without obvious artefacts or mode collapse.

**6. Difficulty Level**

Difficulty: Advanced

This task requires modelling multivariate temporal dynamics, cross-asset relationships, and non-Gaussian risk characteristics within a generative modelling framework.
