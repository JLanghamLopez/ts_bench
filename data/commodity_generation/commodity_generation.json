    "description": "Task: Multivariate Generative Modelling of Commodity Log-Return Trajectories\n\n**1. Task Overview**\n\nThis task evaluates a model\u2019s ability to generate realistic 60-day multivariate log-return trajectories for nine major commodities.\nThe goal is to reproduce medium-term market behaviour, including volatility patterns, cross-market co-movements, and risk-sensitive characteristics of the joint distribution.\n\nTask Type: Generative modelling  \nTrajectory Shape: [60, 9] log-return sequences  \n\n**2. Task Description**\n\nParticipants must train a generative model capable of producing realistic 60-day paths of daily log-returns across the following commodities:\ngold, silver, copper, crude_oil_wti, crude_oil_brent, natural_gas, corn, wheat, and soybeans.\n\nEach data sample is a window of 60 consecutive daily log-returns across these nine commodities.\nThe trained model should be able to generate new trajectories with the same shape and comparable statistical and temporal properties to those observed in the real data.\n\nAny generative architecture may be used (for example, diffusion models, GANs, normalizing flows, or signature-based models), provided that the generated output matches the required dimensions and format.\n\n**3. Dataset**\n\nThe dataset consists of log-return time series constructed from daily settlement prices for the nine commodities.\nThe series have been segmented into overlapping windows using a 60-day window and a stride of 5 days, resulting in [60, 9] log-return trajectories that capture medium-term dynamics.\n\nPredefined splits are provided:\n- Train set  \n- Validation set  \n- Test set  \n\nParticipants should use the train and validation sets for model training and tuning.\nThe test set will not be provided; final ranking is based solely on performance on the held-out test set using the primary metric (HistogramMetric).\n\n**4. Evaluation**\n\nModels will be evaluated by comparing generated trajectories to real test trajectories using three metrics:\n\n- HistogramMetric  \n  Measures distributional similarity between real and generated trajectories by comparing empirical histograms of returns.\n\n- CrossCorrelationMetric  \n  Compares lagged cross-correlations between commodities, assessing whether inter-market temporal dependencies are preserved.\n\n- AutoCorrelationMetric  \n  Evaluates within-series autocorrelation patterns, capturing temporal persistence and volatility behaviour of individual commodity return processes.\n\nHistogramMetric serves as the primary ranking metric.  \nCrossCorrelationMetric and AutoCorrelationMetric provide complementary information on cross-asset and temporal structure.  \nEvaluation metric code for all three metrics will be provided to participants.\n\n**5. Success Criteria**\n\nA successful submission should:\n- Achieve low discrepancy on HistogramMetric on the test set.  \n- Preserve cross-commodity temporal dependence patterns reflected by CrossCorrelationMetric.  \n- Match temporal persistence and volatility characteristics measured by AutoCorrelationMetric. \n- Produce stable and realistic trajectories without obvious artefacts or mode collapse.\n\n**6. Difficulty Level**\n\nDifficulty: Advanced\n\nThis task requires modelling multivariate temporal dynamics, cross-asset relationships, and non-Gaussian risk characteristics within a generative modelling framework.",
